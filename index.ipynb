    "    You've been tasked with designing an experiment to test whether a new email template will be more effective for your company's marketing team. The current template has a 5% response rate (with standard deviation .0475), which has outperformed numerous other templates in the past. The company is excited to test the new design that was developed internally but nervous about losing sales if it is not to work out. As a result, they are looking to determine how many individuals they will need to serve the new email template in order to detect a 1% performance increase.\n",

For example, how much does the required sample size increase if you put the more stringent criteria of $\\alpha=.01$? Or what is the sample size required to detect a .03 response rate difference at the same $\\alpha$ and power thresholds? To investigate this, plot power vs sample size curves for alpha values of .01, .05 and .1 along with varying response rate differences of .005, .01, .02 and .03."
